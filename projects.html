      <p class= "about">This package delivery service is local to Salt Lake City, Utah. The project is able to <strong>deliver 40 packages</strong> in a 
      	 mileage efficient way. This UPS system utilizes a <strong>greedy algorithm</strong> paired with a <Strong>nearest neighbor approach.</Strong>
      	 The command line interface allows the user to track the movements of an individual package
      	 (preferably for the customer's use), or all of the packages being delivered that day. When the packages have all been delivered,
      	 the user is able to see how many miles each truck traveled, and the total mileage for the day.
      	 The restraints on this project is that there are 3 trucks, but only 2 drivers. Certain packages
      	 need to be delivered on the same truck, and some packages arrive late to the delivery hub.</p>

      <p class="about">This program uses <strong>machine learning</strong> to detect if the current student is at risk of failing.
      	 Using over <strong>6,500 student records</strong> (correlating to the sliders in the video), the "Dropout Risk Analyzer" is able to 
      	 determine a confidence level for the current student. After deciding if the student is "Low-risk" or "High-risk",
      	 the program is able to <strong>generate multiple normal distribution graphs</strong> to compare with other students. This program
      	 is aimed to help professors, counselors, and mentors understand their individual students more, and provide students with additional
      	 resources if they are deemed to be "At-risk". This web application is programmed in Python. </p>

      <p class="about">The robot maintains an internal representation of the disaster environment by <strong>dynamically updating a map based on real-time sensor data and object detection events.</strong> This representation is stored using structured data containers such as a dictionary, allowing for efficient categorization, lookup, and visualization.
		When the robot encounters physical debris through its sensingNose sensor, it retrieves the object's alias ("Cylinder3" for example) and <strong>logs its world coordinates in a dictionary</strong> called self.debrisMap. This enables the robot to avoid redundant logging and provides responders with a map of obstructed paths.
	
		The robot has 3 main sensors:</p>
		<ol><li><strong style="color: #98FF98;">Nose sensor:</strong> This sensor detects when the robot runs into debris, allowing him to try and wiggle out of the way, or do a complete 180-degree turn. Identifies debris and marks coordinates on the map.</li>
			<li><strong style="color: #98FF98;"">Fire sensor:</strong> Detects if a fire is within range of the robot; marks coordinates for where the fire was detected</li>
			<li><strong style="color: #98FF98;">Person sensor:</strong> Detects injured people in a disaster; marks the location of the person for first responders.</li>
